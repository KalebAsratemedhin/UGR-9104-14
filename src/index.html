            Kaleb is a master of the fine art of full stack developement. He is
            one short of a magician in that world. I am glad for having worked
            with him.

            I love how he is kind, curious and cares about his coworkers. He is
            the spirt of the team wherever he goes.

            If you want your project to be a success and completed on time, he
            is the guy to go to. In the two years and 3 months that we worked
            together, I haven't seen him fail to acomplish his projects as he
            promised to customers. Never!
